# upload-and-download-encrypted-file-in-PHP

First you have to create two folders names upload and download resp.
two folders should be created in particular server folder 
(means in wampp server folder should be in www folder and in xampp server it should be in htdocs folder and for linux you acn also use lampp).
open the browser and type localhost/folder name/ index.php
it will open the html page where you can select and upload the file. 
files are store in encrypted format in upload folder. 
you can also download the files directly from the browser.
upload folder contain the encrypted file and download folder contain decrypted files
